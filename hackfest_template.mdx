## Project Description

F5 has different different products covering WAF needs as per customer requirements. BigIp, Nginx App Protect and F5 Distributed Cloud provide WAF support and as of now we don't have a tool/script to generate a custom WAF which can be created and used for customer deployments. So the main purpose of this project is to have a unified tool/UI using which customer can get expected WAF bundles as per their product requirement.
