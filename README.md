## Project Description

Main purpose of this project is to have a unified tool/UI using which customer can get expected WAF bundles as per their product requirement.

## Key Hypothesis

F5 has different different products covering WAF needs as per customer requirements. BigIp, Nginx App Protect and F5 Distributed Cloud provide WAF support and as of now we don't have a tool/script to generate a custom WAF which can be created and used for customer deployments.

## How It Works

Application is written in flask and is deployed as k8s pod. K8s service is created to publish this over internet so users can access the application.

## Business Value

This project provides a unified location to create custom WAF bundle as per customer WAF product.

## Technologies Used
